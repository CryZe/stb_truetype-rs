# stb_truetype-rs

This is a straight translation of
[stb_truetype.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_truetype.h)
from C to Rust. It is intended as a stopgap dependency for libraries that deal
with fonts until something better, written in idiomatic Rust, is available. This
library is not an example of good Rust code, but it works.
